# Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing

## Project Overview
This project focuses on reducing the time Mercedes-Benz cars spend on the test bench. By optimizing testing time using advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to enhance production efficiency and reduce carbon emissions without compromising vehicle safety and reliability standards.

## Features
- **Variance Thresholding**: Removal of features with zero variance.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling of null values and encoding of categorical variables.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Application of PCA to reduce the dataset to its most informative features.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using XGBoost for predicting the testing time based on vehicle features.
